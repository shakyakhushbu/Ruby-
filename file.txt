we Cant create file with r and r+
we Cant create file with w and w+.a and a+



# f = File.new("hlw.txt","w")
# f = File.open("Hlw.txt","w")
# f.syswrite("Hello")
# f.close




# f = f.sysread("hlw.txt","r+")
# con = f.readlines()
# puts con 
#here you cant open file because it is only i write mode



# f = File.new("Hlw.txt","w+")
# f.close
# f = File.open("Hlw.txt","w")#it will open in only read write mode not in read mode only
# f.syswrite("Hello World")
# f.close



#r+ starts at beginning of file, but will not create a new file if it doesn't exists.
#w+ truncates existing file to zero length if the file exists, otherwise creates a new file.
#a+ starts at end of file if file exists, otherwise creates a new file.
